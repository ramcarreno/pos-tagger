    "    - Catalan language has a lot of particles that don't have meaning per se but are constantly (and necessarily) used - e.g. different kind of pronouns, verb tenses that require a composition of verbs, etc. \n",
    "    - After a small processing it has been discovered that the word \"del\" (which means \"from the\") is included in the corpus, followed by the two words that compose it: \"de\" (from) and \"el\" (the), which leads to having three tokens (\"del\" tagged as `-`, \"de\" tagged as `adp` and \"el\" tagged as `det`). This is also one of the factors that increase the length of the sentence. It is also important to take this into account when performing the analysis of the viterbi algorithm.\n",

For instance, there seems to be a bias towards assigning some of those to `propn` (proper nouns). But again, we would need to check the context in the sentences.\n",
    "* These are important to have in mind, since they can be problematic when performing our tests and analysis of viterbi. Having so many tags assigned can make the algorithm to be unstable when predicting the tag for words like \"força\", \"total\", \"segons\", \"mateix\" and \"cap\". Predicting a wrong tag for those, can make the rest of the sentence carry over the error."
