# POS-tagger
POS tagger for the English language made with datasets from Universal Dependencies.

# Getting started
Once we finish state how to get started (install dependencies, etc)

# Ideas for the analysis
Putting it here atm to have it in mind:

* Analyze results with the datasets, plot matrixes with the happy path and probabilities
    * Compare probabilities when a result is correct
    * Compare probabilities when a result is incorrect
* Analyze complexity, compare with the nltk HMM method.
* Compare with multiplication and addition maybe?
* Compare using matrices vs dicts

# Tasks
- [] Build "predict" -> build the class
- [] Refactor code and convert to class
- [] Performance analysis (computationally-wise)
- [] Performance analysis (algorithm quality-wise: e.g. precision, recall, etc -> 2 languages datasets, how making an error propagates errors)
- [] EDA (Exploratory data analysis)
- [] ⚠️ States -> convert to list !! ⚠️
