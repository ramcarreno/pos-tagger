# POS-tagger
POS tagger for the English language made with datasets from Universal Dependencies.

# Getting started
Once we finish state how to get started (install dependencies, etc)

# Ideas for the analysis
Putting it here atm to have it in mind:

* Analyze results with the datasets, plot matrixes with the happy path and probabilities
    * Compare probabilities when a result is correct
    * Compare probabilities when a result is incorrect
* Analyze complexity, compare with the nltk HMM method.
* Compare with multiplication and addition maybe?
